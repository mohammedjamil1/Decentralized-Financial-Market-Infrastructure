# Decentralized Financial Market Infrastructure

A comprehensive blockchain-based financial market infrastructure built on Stacks using Clarity smart contracts. This system provides institutional-grade trading, clearing, settlement, risk management, and regulatory compliance capabilities in a decentralized environment.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The infrastructure consists of five core smart contracts that work together to create a complete financial market ecosystem:

### Core Contracts

1. **Institution Verification Contract** (`institution-verification.clar`)
    - Validates and manages financial entities
    - Handles institution registration, verification, and status management
    - Manages trading permissions and risk limits

2. **Settlement Protocol Contract** (`settlement-protocol.clar`)
    - Manages transaction finalization
    - Handles asset and cash transfers between parties
    - Ensures atomic settlement of trades

3. **Clearing Mechanism Contract** (`clearing-mechanism.clar`)
    - Handles trade clearing and netting
    - Manages participant positions and exposures
    - Calculates net settlement obligations

4. **Risk Management Contract** (`risk-management.clar`)
    - Monitors systemic and individual risks
    - Manages margin requirements and collateral
    - Provides real-time risk assessment

5. **Regulatory Compliance Contract** (`regulatory-compliance.clar`)
    - Ensures market rule adherence
    - Manages KYC/AML compliance
    - Handles violation tracking and reporting

## üöÄ Features

### Institution Management
- **Registration & Verification**: Streamlined onboarding process for financial institutions
- **Permission Management**: Granular control over trading, clearing, and settlement permissions
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of institution status and capabilities

### Trade Lifecycle Management
- **Trade Submission**: Secure trade entry and validation
- **Clearing Process**: Automated trade clearing with position netting
- **Settlement Execution**: Atomic settlement with DVP (Delivery vs Payment) guarantees

### Risk Controls
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous assessment of participant and system-wide risks
- **Margin Management**: Dynamic margin calculation and monitoring
- **Exposure Limits**: Configurable risk limits with automatic enforcement

### Regulatory Compliance
- **KYC/AML Integration**: Built-in compliance checks for all participants
- **Violation Tracking**: Comprehensive audit trail for regulatory violations
- **Reporting Framework**: Automated regulatory reporting capabilities

## üìã Prerequisites

- Stacks blockchain node or access to testnet/mainnet
- Clarity CLI for contract deployment
- Node.js 18+ for running tests

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Deployment

### 1. Clone the Repository
\`\`\`bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd defi-market-infrastructure
\`\`\`

### 2. Deploy Contracts
Deploy contracts in the following order to ensure proper dependencies:

\`\`\`bash
# Deploy institution verification first
clarinet deploy contracts/institution-verification.clar

# Deploy regulatory compliance
clarinet deploy contracts/regulatory-compliance.clar

# Deploy risk management
clarinet deploy contracts/risk-management.clar

# Deploy clearing mechanism
clarinet deploy contracts/clearing-mechanism.clar

# Deploy settlement protocol
clarinet deploy contracts/settlement-protocol.clar
\`\`\`

### 3. Initialize System
After deployment, initialize the system with basic configuration:

\`\`\`clarity
;; Set up initial compliance rules
(contract-call? .regulatory-compliance create-compliance-rule
"KYC-001"
"All participants must complete KYC verification"
u10000)

;; Configure risk parameters
(contract-call? .risk-management set-risk-profile
'SP1EXAMPLE...
u5
u1000000
u50000)
\`\`\`

## üîß Usage Examples

### Institution Registration
\`\`\`clarity
;; Register a new institution
(contract-call? .institution-verification register-institution
"Example Bank"
"Commercial Bank")

;; Verify the institution (admin only)
(contract-call? .institution-verification verify-institution
'SP1EXAMPLE...)
\`\`\`

### Trade Execution Flow
\`\`\`clarity
;; 1. Submit trade for clearing
(contract-call? .clearing-mechanism submit-trade
'SP1BUYER...
'SP1SELLER...
"AAPL"
u100
u150)

;; 2. Clear the trade
(contract-call? .clearing-mechanism clear-trade u1)

;; 3. Initiate settlement
(contract-call? .settlement-protocol initiate-settlement
u1
'SP1BUYER...
'SP1SELLER...
"AAPL"
u100
u150)

;; 4. Execute settlement
(contract-call? .settlement-protocol execute-settlement u1)
\`\`\`

### Risk Monitoring
\`\`\`clarity
;; Check risk limits before trade
(contract-call? .risk-management check-risk-limits
'SP1PARTICIPANT...
u50000)

;; Update exposure after trade
(contract-call? .risk-management update-exposure
'SP1PARTICIPANT...
50000)
\`\`\`

## üß™ Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

\`\`\`bash
npm test
\`\`\`

Tests cover:
- Contract deployment and initialization
- Institution verification workflows
- Trade clearing and settlement processes
- Risk management scenarios
- Regulatory compliance checks
- Error handling and edge cases

## üìä Contract Specifications

### Data Structures

#### Institution Data
- **Name**: Institution identifier
- **Type**: Institution category (bank, broker, etc.)
- **Status**: Verification status (pending, verified, suspended, revoked)
- **Permissions**: Trading and operational permissions

#### Trade Data
- **Participants**: Buyer and seller principals
- **Asset**: Traded instrument identifier
- **Quantity**: Number of units
- **Price**: Price per unit
- **Status**: Current trade status

#### Risk Metrics
- **Exposure Limits**: Maximum allowed exposure per participant
- **Margin Requirements**: Collateral requirements
- **Risk Levels**: Current risk assessment (low, medium, high, critical)

### Error Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| u100-103 | Institution verification errors |
| u200-204 | Settlement protocol errors |
| u300-303 | Clearing mechanism errors |
| u400-403 | Risk management errors |
| u500-503 | Regulatory compliance errors |

## üîí Security Considerations

### Access Controls
- **Owner-only functions**: Critical administrative functions restricted to contract owner
- **Participant validation**: All operations validate participant eligibility
- **Status checks**: Continuous verification of institution and compliance status

### Risk Mitigation
- **Atomic operations**: Settlement operations are atomic to prevent partial failures
- **Exposure limits**: Hard limits prevent excessive risk concentration
- **Margin requirements**: Collateral requirements protect against counterparty risk

### Audit Trail
- **Immutable records**: All transactions and status changes are permanently recorded
- **Event logging**: Comprehensive event emission for external monitoring
- **Compliance tracking**: Full audit trail for regulatory reporting
